# sustain
A full collection of code within my app for the District Authority Scholarship computer science project.

THIS IS INTENDED FOR DISTRICT AUTHORITY SCHOLARSHIP USE ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT COPY ANY OF THE CODE.

TO THE DISTRICT AUTHORITY SCHOLARSHIP ADJUDICATION COMMITEE,

MY NAME IS JOCELYN ZHAO AND THIS IS THE CODE FOR MY MAJOR PROJECT -- MY APP, SUSTAIN.
IN THE USB PROVIDED, THERE SHOULD BE A VIDEO DEMONSTRATING THE PLATFORM I USED (XCODE),
HOW I INTERACT WITH THE FILES SHOWN HERE AND HOW THE APP LOOK ON A SIMULATOR IPHONE. 
THERE ARE ALSO HARD FILES OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDED ON THAT USB, HOWEVER, I WAS WORRIED
THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE SPECIFIC APPLE SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO OPEN THEM SO I 
INCLUDED THEM HERE. THE ASSETS FILE IS FULL OF PHOTOS ASSOCIATED WITH THE APP, WHICH
GITHUB CANNOT OPEN. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LAYOUT OF INSERTING THE PHOTOS,
PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO.

THANK YOU.

JOCELYN ZHAO
